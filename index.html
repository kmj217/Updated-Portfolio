                            I grew up just south of Pittsburgh, PA in a small town called Washington. I stayed there until i graduated Highschool and decided to join the United States Navy. My journey with Navy first took me to Illinois for bootcamp. From there I travled down to Chalestown, SC to begin my training to become a Nuclear Electronics Technician. After two years of schooling, I was sent to Groton, CT to where I would be a part of the crew on the fast attack submarine, the USS Pittsburgh SSN 720 for 4 years.

                            After my 6 years in the Navy, I made the decision to leave to teach others. I was hired on by Westinghouse as a Senior Nuclear Operations Instructor which is what I have been doing since. Now I am looking for a new challenge to take on to express my creativity in the form of coding. This will be a whole new journey but I am truly excited to develop my skillset to all new heights.
